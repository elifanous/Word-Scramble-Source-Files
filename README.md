This repository contains all the source code/files for the Word Scramble game I made in Unity. This is my first actual game that I made on my own, and really helped to teach me the basics of Unity and Unity 2D. However, due to the fact that it *is* my first solo game, some parts of the code are simply horrendous, and the overall structure and organization of both the code and assets are confusing and contradictory. In the end, though, I think it turned out decently, although I shudder at the thought of having to make changes to it, what with the way everything is organized. Despite that, I do plan to make updates to it in the future, as I already have more ideas for features that could be added. Either way, it was a nice intro to Unity, and I hope to start learning a bit more Unity 3D at some point.
